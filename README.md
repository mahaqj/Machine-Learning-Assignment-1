# CS4090: Machine Learning for Robotics
Assignment 1 by Maha Qaiser 22i-2348

I'm building machine learning models that predict the popularity of songs on Spotify (target variable: popularity) based on various audio features and metadata provided in the dataset. The goal is to understand which features contribute most to a song's popularity and to create a model that can accurately predict how popular a song will be.
